                            The first Flash. Jay Garrick accidently inhaled hard water vapors and as a result he could run at superhuman speed. His costume design was a shirt with a lightning bolt and a helmet similiar to the one of the god Mercury. He is also a founding member of the Justice Society of America. Although Jay Garrick was the first Flash he is from Earth-2. The New 52 version of Jay gets his powers from the roman god Mercury.

                        <h3>Barry Allen </h3>
                        <p>
                            Barry Allen is second and most known Flash. He is a forensic scientist and is often late for work so one day he was late and a lightining bolt hit some chemicals that fell on him and he woke up with super speed.
                            Allen also made the cosmic treadmill which is a treadmill that can be used for time travel. He is one of the founding members of the Justice League along with Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Aquaman, and Martian Manhunter.
                            He is also the "creator" of the Multiverse when he is transported to Earth-2 and meets Jay Garrick. On Crisis on Infinite Earths Allen has to stop the Anti-Monitor and had to go so fast his body could not take it and he dies and his nephew, Wally West who gained his speed the same way becomes the Flash. Barry is shown in the Green Arrow story Quiver as a spirit although he seems to still be alive within the speed force. After 23 years away from comics Barry Allen returns in the comic DC Universe #0. During Blackest Night Barry was temporarily a blue lantern corp. During Flashpoint, Allen wakes up in a universe completely different from his normal one and Zoom eventually reveals to him that this happened because The Flash went back in time and stopped Zoom from killing Barrys mother. Then Barry tries to Undo these things by preventing his other self from stopping Zoom from killing his mother. In the New 52 Allen is never with Iris and he is instead with his co-worker Patty Spivot. He also does not have full control over his powers. Barry is also a main member of the Justice League.

                        <h3>Wally West </h3>

                            Wally West is the nephew of Barry Allen and when he was visiting Barry the same accident that happened on Barry repeated itsef on Wally. He then got a smaller version of Allens costume and becaem Kid Flash. His costume was later changed to one that was primarily yellow. Wally later becomes The Flash after Barry dies and stays as the main FLash for many years until Barry returns. During the New 52 storyline Wally has a completely different backstory and he is now African-American.

                        <h3>Bart Allen </h3>
                        <p>
                          Bart Allen got his powers when he was born as he is the grandson of Barry Allen and inherited his power. Bart was born with super high metabolism which made him age way faster then anyone else so Wally West tricked him into running super fast and with that it paused his metabolism. Bart eventually joined the Teen Titans with Robin and Superboy and became Impulse. In Bart's time during the Teen Titans, Deathstroke shot him in the knee. While Bart was recovering he read every book in the San Francisco Library and Re-invented the title of Kid Flash. When Bart's roommate got powers and became the Griffin, Bart discovered he had absorbed the Speed Force and he had to learn to control it. Bart decided to follow Barry's footsteps and became The Flash. When Bart fought the Rogues as Flash he wasnt able to handle them and died. When Brainiac 5 continues his plan to defeat Superboy-Prime he brings back Bart as a teenager and he is Kid Flash again. In the New 52 Bart, does not know how he has his speed, but is sure he has some connection to The Flash.

This froce is extremely powerful as seen when Jay Garrick gets the Speed Force he becomes much faster. This also serves as an afterlife for speedsters and is where Barry was when he died. In the New 52 the Speed Force almost doesnt exist mainly because current DC CEO, Geoff Jhons does not like the Speed force and says it is compeletely absurd.
